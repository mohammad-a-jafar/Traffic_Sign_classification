# Traffic_Sign_classification
This project focuses on evaluating the impact of low-light and extreme weather conditions on traffic sign classification accuracy, a crucial task in autonomous driving systems. Most existing work in traffic sign classification has been based on ideal conditions, neglecting factors such as poor visibility and adverse weather. To address this, I developed six custom datasets derived from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) to simulate low-light and extreme weather scenarios, including snow, rain, and fog. Using these datasets, I trained multiple classifiers with the YOLOv8 model and compared the performance of a single model across all conditions versus specialized models for each weather scenario. The results revealed that low-light conditions had a relatively minor impact on accuracy, reducing it by 7.34%. In contrast, snowy and rainy conditions had a significant negative effect, with accuracy drops of 57.67% and 37.12%, respectively. Foggy conditions caused the least reduction in accuracy, with a drop of only 6.22%. This research highlights the challenges posed by weather-related factors and offers insights for improving traffic sign recognition systems in autonomous vehicles.
